# Addition (+) → Adds two numbers.Subtraction (-) 
# #Subtracts one number from another.
# #Multiplication (*) → Multiplies two numbers.
#Division (/) → Performs normal division and returns a float (decimal number).
#Floor Division (//) → Divides two numbers and returns an integer (removes the decimal part).
#Modulus (%) → Returns the remainder when one number is divided by another.
#Exponentiation (**) → Raises one number to the power of another (e.g., 10 ** 5 means 10^5).
